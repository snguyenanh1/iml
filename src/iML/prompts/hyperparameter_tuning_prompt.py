You are an expert ML engineer. Your task is to analyze the provided successful ML pipeline code and generate a Python script that performs hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.

## SUCCESSFUL PIPELINE CODE TO ANALYZE
Below is the complete, working pipeline code that successfully trained a model and generated predictions:

```python
{final_executable_code}
```

## YOUR TASK
Analyze the above code and create a hyperparameter tuning script that:
1. **Extracts the exact file paths** used in the successful pipeline 
2. **Reuses the preprocessing logic** from the successful code
3. **Creates a tunable version** of the model training process
4. **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT**: After optimization, trains a final model with best parameters and creates `submission_tuned.csv`

## TUNING SETTINGS
- Number of trials: {n_trials}
- Direction: {direction}
- Sampler: {sampler}
- Pruner: {pruner}
- Timeout (seconds): {timeout}
{fast_training_instructions}

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: FINAL PREDICTIONS
🚨 **MANDATORY**: Your script MUST include a final training step that:
1. Takes the best hyperparameters found by Optuna
2. Trains a final model with these best parameters on the full training data
3. Generates predictions on the test dataset
4. Saves these predictions to `submission_tuned.csv` in the current working directory

This is NOT optional - every hyperparameter tuning script must produce `submission_tuned.csv`.

## HYPERPARAMETERS TO TUNE
Select a small set of the most impactful hyperparameters (2-4) to tune. Avoid tuning trivial parameters to save time and resources.

## ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
1. **Extract file_paths**: Look for the `file_paths` variable or file loading logic in the successful code
2. **Identify preprocess function**: Find how data preprocessing is done
3. **Identify train function**: Find the model training and evaluation logic
4. **Identify hyperparameters**: Look for model parameters that can be tuned (learning_rate, n_estimators, etc.)

## REQUIREMENTS
1. Import necessary modules: `optuna`, `json`, `pickle`, `sys`, and any others needed.
2. **CRITICAL**: Extract and use the exact same file paths and data loading logic from the successful code.
3. Recreate the preprocessing steps from the successful code.
4. Create an Optuna `Study` using the given sampler and pruner, with direction `{direction}`.
5. Define `objective(trial)` that:
   - Uses the extracted file paths to load data exactly like the successful code
   - Uses `trial.suggest_*` methods to select 2-4 key hyperparameters.
   - Trains the model with suggested hyperparameters and returns validation accuracy.
6. Optimize the study with `n_trials={n_trials}` and `timeout={timeout}`.
7. After tuning, save best parameters to `hyperparam_results.json` and the study object to `optuna_study.pkl`.
8. **CRITICALLY IMPORTANT - FINAL TRAINING STEP**: After optimization completes, use the best parameters to:
   - Train a final model with the best hyperparameters on the full training dataset
   - Generate predictions on the test dataset 
   - Save predictions to `submission_tuned.csv` (NOT submission.csv) in current working directory
9. This final training step is MANDATORY and must be included in your script.
10. Wrap the main block with `if __name__ == '__main__'`, handle exceptions printing to stderr and exit with `sys.exit(1)`.
11. Return only the complete Python code in a ```python ... ``` block.

        # ... use best_params to configure and train model ...
        
        # Generate predictions on test data
        # test_predictions = final_model.predict(X_test_processed)

## ⚡ FAST TRAINING MODE ENABLED
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: To fit within time constraints, use reduced training for trials:
- **Reduce epochs**: Use 5-15 epochs for objective function (instead of 50-200)
- **Reduce dataset**: Use 20-30% of training data for validation during tuning
- **Early stopping**: Use aggressive early stopping (patience=2-3)
- **Batch size**: Use larger batch sizes (256-512) to speed up training
- **Model size**: Consider smaller model architectures during tuning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Only the FINAL model training (after optimization) should use full data and epochs!
